PROBLEM1
Define the problem-
A man is crossing a river on his boat. He has three items with him. A cat, a parrot, and a bag of seeds.
His boat is only big enough to carry him and one of his items. He has to be careful who he leaves alone
because the cat will eat the parrot and the parrot will eat the seed. How does he get all passengers to the other side
without leaving the wrong ones alone together? You have to get all the passengers to the other side without leaving
the cat and parrot alone, or the parrot and seed alone.
Break the problem apart-

Identify potential solutions-

evaluate each potential solution-

Choose a solution and develop a plan to implement it-



PROBLEM2
Define the problem-
You have 20 socks in a jar, 10 black socks, 6 brown socks, and 4 white socks. Turn the light off and select a sock.
Once you select a sock you can turn the light on and see what you selected. What is the smallest number of socks you
need to select to guarantee you will get one matching pair? What is the smallest number of socks you
need to select to guarantee you will get one matching pair of each color? Think of how many pairs of socks there are
and how many you have to pick at random to solve your problem.

PROBLEM3
Define the problem-
A girl counts the fingers on her left hand starting from one and counting endlessly. She starts at her thumb,
then pointer finger, then middle finger, then ring finger, and then pinky finger. She then reverses
and goes to ring finger, middle finger, pointer finger, and thumb. She then reverses again.
If she does this over and over, what finger will she stop on when she gets to 10, 100, and 1000? Think of the order
she counts her finger and what pattern goes with it.
