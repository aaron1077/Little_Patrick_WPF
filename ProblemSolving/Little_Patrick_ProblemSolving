PROBLEM1
Define the problem-
A man is crossing a river on his boat. He has three items with him. A cat, a parrot, and a bag of seeds.
His boat is only big enough to carry him and one of his items. He has to be careful who he leaves alone
because the cat will eat the parrot and the parrot will eat the seed. How does he get all passengers to the other side
without leaving the wrong ones alone together? You have to get all the passengers to the other side without leaving
the cat and parrot alone, or the parrot and seed alone.
Break the problem apart-
The constraints are that you cant leave certain passengers alone with others and that only one passenger
can be onboard at a time. the sub goals are getting all passengers across and getting them across one at a time.
The other sub goal is to not leave the cat with the parrot or the parrot with the seed.
Identify potential solutions-
A potential solution would be to take a passenger one at a time across the river and also keep a passenger
with you when you go back across so you can exchange the passenger to get the order right.
evaluate each potential solution-
This solution works and is good. It's not a crazy solution but it solves the problem. This solution would work every
time with this same criteria.
Choose a solution and develop a plan to implement it-



PROBLEM2
Define the problem-
You have 20 socks in a jar, 10 black socks, 6 brown socks, and 4 white socks. Turn the light off and select a sock.
Once you select a sock you can turn the light on and see what you selected. What is the smallest number of socks you
need to select to guarantee you will get one matching pair? What is the smallest number of socks you
need to select to guarantee you will get one matching pair of each color? Think of how many pairs of socks there are
and how many you have to pick at random to solve your problem.
Break the problem apart-
The sub goal is one matching pair and the other sub goal is one matching pair of each color.
The constraints are you have to do it at random.
Identify potential solutions-
A potential solution would be to select socks at random until you get a match, once you get a match you have one of
your answers. Then keep going until you select a match for all three.
evaluate each potential solution-
This solution will work every time. In this senario picking socks blindly, finding matches, itll work no matter what.
It's a process of elimination.

PROBLEM3
Define the problem-
A girl counts the fingers on her left hand starting from one and counting endlessly. She starts at her thumb,
then pointer finger, then middle finger, then ring finger, and then pinky finger. She then reverses
and goes to ring finger, middle finger, pointer finger, and thumb. She then reverses again.
If she does this over and over, what finger will she stop on when she gets to 10, 100, and 1000? Think of the order
she counts her finger and what pattern goes with it.
Break the problem apart-
The constraints is that she counts a specific way, so you have to follow her pattern.
The sub goals is to find the way she counts and find the pattern that goes with it.
Identify potential solutions-
A potential solution would be to count on your fingers to find the pattern. Once you find the pattern see what
fingers land on multiples of 10.
evaluate each potential solution-
This might not be the best way to come up with a solution to a problem like this, but giving this exact problem it
works perfect and is fast.
